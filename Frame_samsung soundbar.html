           <p>4. Samsung HW-Q990D soundbar<p/>
           <p>*The best Dolby Atmos soundbar, and now perfect for PS5 and Xbox Series X<p/>
           <ul Type = "Circle">
           <LI>The Samsung HW-Q990D carries on the legacy of its predecessor, the Samsung HW-Q990C, and adds much sought after gaming features, with an 120Hz compatible HDMI 2.1 port. In our Samsung HW-Q990D review, we found it to be not only the best way to boost your movie viewing experience, but it also served as an excellent companion for music as well. 
           <LI>Bass levels are weighty but with a nuanced touch, speech is clear, trebles and mids can breathe and Dolby Atmos surround sound is incredibly immersive, with excellent placement and a real sense of direction. An 11.1.4 speaker array, spread across 22 speakers and some genius processing make the Q990D quite simply, the best Dolby Atmos soundbar weâ€™ve tested so far in 2024.
